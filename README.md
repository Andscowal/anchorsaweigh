# Anchors Aweigh!

A fun take on the whack-a-mole game!
A work in progress, but once completed, the objective will be to anchor down any ships that appear with a click!

Built using React.js, this project will demonstrate how useful React.js is when lifecycle events
update the state of an object! 

Currently, the div (card) all update at randomly the first time, but not on flip so that needs to be changed!

The idea is to click the card when they flip to where the ship is showing, to flip them back "to anchor down the ships"!
I added a counter for the number of times the ship has been anchored.

Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
