# anchorsaweigh

A fun take on the whack-a-mole game!
A work in progress, but once completed, the objective will be to anchor down any ships that appear!

Built using React.js, this project will demonstrate how useful React.js is when lifecycle events
update the state of an object!

Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
