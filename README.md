# Anchors Aweigh!

A fun take on the whack-a-mole game!
A work in progress, but once completed, the objective will be to anchor down any ships that appear with a click!

Built using React.js, this project will demonstrate how useful React.js is when lifecycle events
update the state of an object! 

Currently, the divs (cards) all update at once and are on the same timer.
My next objective is to apply internal functionality to the individual cards so that the timer will be randomly set to flip the 
cards. The idea is to click the cards when they flip to where the ship is showing, to flip them back "to anchor down the ships"!

Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
